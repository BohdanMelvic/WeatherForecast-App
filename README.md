# WeatherForecast-App

It's my first full project, which helped me to improve my skills and expand my understanding of Front-End Developing during my studying.
Weather Forecast App provides current weather condition for any city of the world or for your current position.
I used here different technologies such as:

- Bootstrap, JavaScript for Front-End side;
- Node.js - for Back-End side;
- Dark Sky API;
- Mapbox API;
- different useful npm packeges
